Temperature is measured with a thermometer, historically calibrated in various temperature scales and units of measurement. The most commonly used scales are the Celsius scale, denoted in °C (informally, degrees centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale. The kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), in which temperature is one of the seven fundamental base units."
